1)creating table

CREATE TABLE books (
book_id int,
bookName varchar(20),
authorName varchar(25), 
publisherName varchar(20), 
price int);


2)inserting values
 

INSERT INTO books(book_id, bookname, authorName, publisherName, price) VALUES
(1, "Lords of Rings", "Samuel", "Kumar Publishers", 1000),
(2, "Dance of Dragon", "George", "HBO Publishers", 1500),
(3, "Song of Ice and Fire", "Samuel", "Kumar Publishers", 1800),
(4, "Wings of Fire", "Apj", "Apj Publishers", 250),
(5, "Sumanth Story", "Sumanth", "Kumar Publishers", 50);


3) constraints:-

	constraints some set of rules that applied to the columns while declaring
the columns (or creating the tables). And if for got mention the constraint while 
creatin the table, we can use alter command to do it. We can declare constraints 
in 2 ways while create table, one is directly mentioning the constraint after writing
datatypes. Another way is at the end create table command using 'constraint' and we
 need give constaint_name and mention constraint  and Put Column name inside the braces . 

There are 5 constraints are there. They are,
	-NOT NULL
	-UNIQUE
	-CHECK
	-PRIMARY KEY
	-FORIEGN KEY

NOT NULL:
---------
	not null means there should be not null values in that column.

UNIQE:-
--------
	Unique means there should not any duplicate values.

check:
--------
	check means that mentioning range. the values in this column should be range between the condition.

prImary key:
------------
	PRIMARY KEY it is a combnation of both unique and not null. It connot accept any null values and 
also duplicate values. in a table here is only one primary key is allowed.

Foriegn key:
------------

FORIEGN key used to connect two tables. child table is connect using primary key column of parent tablels.
